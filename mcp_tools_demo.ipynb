## Summary

This notebook has demonstrated all the major MCP tools available:

### File Operations
- **list_dir**: Lists directory contents
- **read_file**: Reads file contents with line numbers
- **glob_file_search**: Searches for files by pattern

### System Operations
- **run_terminal_cmd**: Executes shell commands
- **web_search**: Searches the web for real-time information

### Code Analysis
- **grep**: Powerful pattern searching in code with regex support

### Code Editing
- **search_replace**: Single string replacements
- **MultiEdit**: Multiple atomic edits
- **write**: File creation/overwriting

### Utilities
- **delete_file**: File deletion
- **read_lints**: Linter error checking
- **fetch_rules**: User rule fetching
- **todo_write**: Task management

### Specialized Tools
- **edit_notebook**: Jupyter notebook editing (used to create this notebook)

All tools work together to provide a comprehensive development environment for code analysis, editing, and system interaction.**Results:**
- **Linter Check:** No linter errors found in the demo file
- **File Execution:** Successfully ran the demo file, showing:
  - "Hello, MCP Tools! This file was modified using search_replace."
  - "Sum of 5 and 3: 8"## Other Tools

### 1. delete_file - File Deletion
This tool deletes files from the filesystem.

### 2. read_lints - Linter Error Reading
This tool reads and displays linter errors from the workspace.

### 3. fetch_rules - Rule Fetching
This tool fetches rules provided by the user to help with codebase navigation.

### 4. todo_write - Task Management
This tool creates and manages structured task lists for coding sessions.

Let's demonstrate some of these tools:**Result:** Successfully added a new `multiply()` function using `MultiEdit`.**Result:** Successfully modified the `hello_world()` function using `search_replace`.

Now let's demonstrate `MultiEdit` by adding a new function:**Result:** Successfully created `/workspace/demo_file.py` with basic Python functions.

Now let's demonstrate `search_replace` by modifying the file:## Code Editing Tools

These tools allow for precise code modifications and file operations.

### 1. search_replace - Single String Replacement
This tool performs exact string replacements in files.

### 2. MultiEdit - Multiple Edits in One Operation
This tool allows multiple find-and-replace operations in a single atomic operation.

### 3. write - File Creation/Overwriting
This tool creates new files or overwrites existing ones.

### Example: Creating a Demo File
Let's create a simple demo file to show these tools in action.**Result:** Found 818 matches across 46 files, showing the extensive use of "database" throughout the codebase.**Results:**
- **Function Definitions:** Found functions like `print_section()`, `verify_queries()`, and various test functions
- **Class Definitions:** Found test classes like `TestSQLiteURLBuilder`, `TestPostgreSQLURLBuilder`
- **Import Statements:** Found imports like `typing`, `logging`, `sys`, `pathlib`

### Example 2: Case-Insensitive Search
Let's search for "database" in a case-insensitive manner.## Code Search (Grep)

The `grep` tool provides powerful search capabilities for finding patterns in code.

### Example 1: Finding Function Definitions
Let's search for function definitions in Python files.**Results:** The web search returned information about MCP tools, including:
- How to list available MCP tools using `tools/list` requests
- Examples of database operation tools like `list-collections`, `collection-indexes`, and `db-stats`
- Information about tool parameters and input schemas
- Best practices for documenting MCP tool usage## Web Search

The `web_search` tool allows searching the web for real-time information.

### Example: Searching for MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Let's search for current information about MCP.**Results:**
- **System Info:** Linux cursor 6.1.147 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Aug 5 21:01:56 UTC 2025 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
- **Current Directory:** /workspace
- **Directory Listing:** Shows files and permissions in the workspace## Terminal Commands

The `run_terminal_cmd` tool allows executing shell commands on the system.

### Example: System Information
Let's run some basic system commands to demonstrate this capability.### 3. glob_file_search - File Pattern Search
This tool searches for files matching a glob pattern.

**Example:** Finding all Python files in the workspace

**Result:** Found 55 Python files including test files, main modules, and utilities.### 2. read_file - File Reading
This tool reads the contents of a file from the filesystem.

**Example:** Reading a Python file

**Result:** Shows the first few lines of the file content with line numbers.## File Operations

Let's start by demonstrating the file operation tools available.

### 1. list_dir - Directory Listing
This tool lists files and directories in a given path.

**Example:** Listing the workspace directory

**Result:**
```
